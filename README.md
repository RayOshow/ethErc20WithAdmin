# ethErc20WithAdmin

It is eth's erc20 source code adding managing admin functions.
It is based on open zeppin code 
(https://github.com/sikyaNQ/final-token/blob/master/Final)

I merged all authorities to one contract to save storage and improve readability.
I would be trying to update this source for saving gas. :)
